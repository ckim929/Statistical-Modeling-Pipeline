# Data Science
#### STAT 399 Independent Study

**Data Science** is the field of study that extracts meaningful and actionable insights from data, using knowledge of statistics, mathematics, and programming. The vastly increasing volume of data in the world and the realization of its applications have made data science an incredibly popular field.

**Machine Learning** is an important part of data science that is all about making informed predictions. Machine learning works by supplying data and supplying a model that allows the model to find patterns or make predictions.

*Unspervised learning* is one machine learning approach that analyzes and clusters unlabeled datasets. This approach discovers hidden patterns in data without the need for human intervention.

*Supervised learning* is another machine learning approach that utilizes labeled datasets and make predictions based on both of the input and output data. Supervised is separated into two types of problems: *Classification* and *Regression*

Regression algorithms are used to predict a continuous value using the input variables. Regression predicts continuous variables by finding correlations between the dependent and independent variables (i.e. predicting house price, sales, temperature). Classification algorithms use input variables to approximate a discrete output variable. The dataset is divided into different categories and the algorithm estimates discrete values (i.e. 0 and 1, yes and no, true or false). Some examples of classification problems include predicting whether someting is spam or not and sentiment analysis (positive or negative).

In this blog, I will be utilizing the applications of data science concepts by investigating **credit card fraud** in a classification problem. This project will involve working from start to finish through the entire data science project pipeline. I will be using Python and its libraries for data analysis, visualizations, and machine learning.

With GitHub Pages, you can host project blogs, documentation, resumes, portfolios, or any other static content you'd like. Your GitHub repository can easily become its own website. In this course, we'll show you how to set up your own site or blog using GitHub Pages.

- **Who is this for**: Beginners, students, project maintainers, small businesses.
- **What you'll learn**: How to build a GitHub Pages site.
- **What you'll build**: We'll build a simple GitHub Pages site with a blog. We'll use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator.
- **Prerequisites**: If you need to learn about branches, commits, and pull requests, take [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) first.
- **How long**: This course is five steps long and takes less than one hour to complete.

## How to start this course

1. Above these instructions, right-click **Use this template** and open the link in a new tab.
   ![Use this template](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1221423/169618716-fb17528d-f332-4fc5-a11a-eaa23562665e.png)
2. In the new tab, follow the prompts to create a new repository.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository—private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).

3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.
