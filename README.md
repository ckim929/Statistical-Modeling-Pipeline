# Data Science Blog

_STAT 399 Independent Project_

Hello!

Welcome to my blog! My name is Cathy and I am a third-year data science student at Northwestern University.



Data Science is becoming an increasingly popular field because of its numerous applications across industries and for its utilization in solving real-world problems. My hope is that people interested in understanding how data science concepts are applied to solve real-life problems will benefit from this blog.

In this blog, I will be utilizing the applications of data science concepts by investigating credit card fraud in a classification problem. I will be using Python and its libraries for data analysis, visualizations, and machine learning. 

### Problem Statement
In this digital era, credit card usage is higher than it has ever been. [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/568523/preferred-payment-methods-usa/) found that in 2021, 40% of all transactions were made with a credit card. As credit card use grows, the risk of fraud does as well. 

Key findings by [dataprot](https://dataprot.net/statistics/credit-card-fraud-statistics/) include:
- People in their 30s are the most vulnerable to credit card fraud.
- 54% of businesses are “somewhat confident” they would be able to detect fraudulent activity on time.
- By 2023, retailers will lose about $130 billion each year on card-not-present transactions.
- The amount of credit card data available on the dark web increased by 135% last year.
- Card-not-present fraud is now 81% more common than point-of-sale fraud.
- 87% of surveyed adults in the US admit to shopping online over public WiFi.


### Stakeholders

The stakeholders include the credit card companies and the credit card users. Credit card companies are invested in making sure that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase, because doing so would lead to mistrust in credit card usage and loss of trust from the users. Inability to detect fraud cases would also cost the company money. 83% of Americans own at least one credit card and the average American has 3.8 credit cards [Zippia](https://www.zippia.com/advice/credit-card-statistics/#:~:text=83%25%20of%20Americans%20own%20at,American%20has%203.8%20credit%20cards.). Therefore, it can be described that the stakeholders in this problem are the general consumers. Consumers want to stay protected in the purchases that they make which can not only cause monetary loss but also emotional distress. 


### Data Collection Methods
I will be using the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) which has been collected and analyzed during a research colaboration between Worldline and the [Machine Learning Group](https://mlg.ulb.ac.be/wordpress/).outcomes. The dataset includes transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. Due to confidentiality, the dataset contains only numerical input variables (V1, V2,..., V28) from a PCA transformation.

With GitHub Pages, you can host project blogs, documentation, resumes, portfolios, or any other static content you'd like. Your GitHub repository can easily become its own website. In this course, we'll show you how to set up your own site or blog using GitHub Pages.

- **Who is this for**: Beginners, students, project maintainers, small businesses.
- **What you'll learn**: How to build a GitHub Pages site.
- **What you'll build**: We'll build a simple GitHub Pages site with a blog. We'll use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator.
- **Prerequisites**: If you need to learn about branches, commits, and pull requests, take [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) first.
- **How long**: This course is five steps long and takes less than one hour to complete.

## How to start this course

1. Above these instructions, right-click **Use this template** and open the link in a new tab.
   ![Use this template](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1221423/169618716-fb17528d-f332-4fc5-a11a-eaa23562665e.png)
2. In the new tab, follow the prompts to create a new repository.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository—private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
