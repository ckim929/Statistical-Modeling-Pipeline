What is **feature engineering** and why is it important?

A feature represents any measurable input that can be used for analysis. 
Feature *engineering* takes raw observations and converts them into useful features for use in supervised learning. 

Feature engineering is an important process in the data science pipeline because it has a direct impact on creating models with better accuracy. 

Feature engineering consists of various processes, including feature creation, transformations, extractions, EDA, and Benchmark ([Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-feature-engineering-importance-tools-and-techniques-for-machine-learning-2080b0269f10))

The [credit card dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) I am working with is the result of a PCA transformation.
